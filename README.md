This app is for saving my daily expenses, from small as cup of tea to large as flat TV.  The purpose is helping me to track all of my expenses, and I can make a better decision on my future expenses.

It also has the reporting features for monthly and annually, based on the selection date.  Each report is breaking down into the total amount of expenses for every payment type, and every vendor.

In here, it has all of the iOS Swift source code for the app, also has the PHP scripts for the server side functions.
